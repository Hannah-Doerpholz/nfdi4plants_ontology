# DPBO 

With the  DataPLANT biology ontology (DPBO), DataPLANT provides an intermediate ontology that acts as a broker and bridge between the individual researcher/domain experts and main ontology providers.  
You can visualize the class tree of the DPBO and browse for terms at the TIB terminology service with the following link: https://terminology.tib.eu/ts/ontologies/dpbo/terms .

DPBO enables easy and agile collection of missing vocabulary as well as relationships between terms for (meta)data annotation using DataPLANTâ€™s Swate tool. 


#### Note: 
DPBO formerly had the namespace NFDI4PSO, which is now obsolete. Old NFDI4PSO terms correspond to the DPBO term with the same accession number. For example, NFDI4PSO:0000011 (obsolete) corresponds to the term DPBO:0000011.

# Your contribution

We welcome every contribution! If a specific term, relationship or an existing external ontology needed for annotating your data with Swate is missing from the DataPLANT database, you can open an issue. We provide a variety of issue templates depending on your wishes: 

- **Add new term:** Suggest a new term to be added to DPBO
- **Import term:** Suggest a term to import from a registered ontology into DPBO
- **Import ontology:** Request the import of an already existing ontology into the SwateDB if you need >60% of terms from the ontology to annotate your data 
- **Add synonym:** Suggest a synonym for an already existing DPBO term
- **Fix/add xref:** Suggest a new xref or report issue about an incorrect xref
- **Custom template:** For all other issues or concerns
