# dpbo 

With the  DataPLANT biology ontology (dpbo), DataPLANT provides an intermediate ontology that acts as a broker and bridge between the individual researcher/domain experts and main ontology providers.  

dpbo enables easy and agile collection of missing vocabulary as well as relationships between terms for (meta)data annotation using DataPLANTâ€™s Swate tool. 

# Your contribution

We welcome every contribution! If a specific term, relationship or an existing external ontology needed for annotating your data with Swate is missing from the DataPLANT database, you can open an issue. We provide a variety of issue templates depending on your wishes: 

- **Import term:** Suggest a term to import from a registered ontology into dpbo
- **Import ontology:** Request the import of an already existing ontology into the SwateDB if you need >60% of terms from the ontology to annotate your data 
- **New term:** Suggest a new term to be added to dpbo
- **New synonym:** Suggest a synonym for an already existing dpbo term
